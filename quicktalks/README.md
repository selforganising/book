# JavaScript quick talks

5-minute, one-slide presentations on some aspect of the JavaScript language. 

###Guidelines

Use https://github.com/airbnb/javascript as a starting point.

Please choose a JavaScript language feature or idiom and cover:

* What the feature is
* How you would use it
* Why you would use it
* When you might not use it
* Alternatives implementations and [antipatterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern).

Please create a single page to accompany your talk for the GitBook.

Fork the [GitBook](https://github.com/selforganising/book), add a page using [Markdown](http://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/markdown/) under /quicktalks and make a pull request.

You can if you want take an existing quick talk and attempt to improve upon it.

Thank you.
