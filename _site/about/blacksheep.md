# Black Sheep

Access to the Academy classroom is through the coffee shop and down the spiral staircase (please do make sure you introduce yourself to Ben behind the counter).

[Black Sheep](http://www.leavetheherdbehind.com/) are Collective members and they make the best coffee in London.

They are in the final hours of their [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/832525384/black-sheep-coffee) to fund the conversion of No. 26 into the best coffee shop in London and they are offering us a fantastic deal to help them meet their target.

You have two options:

* £50 for "all you can drink" coffees and teas Monday-Friday for 8 weeks
* £190 for all you can drink + 40 gourmet toasts (lunch every day) + 40 basic toasts (breakfast)  Monday-Friday for 8 weeks  

Please go now and sign up for their [campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/832525384/black-sheep-coffee) (pledge either £50 or £190 and ask for "no reward").
