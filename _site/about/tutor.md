## Responsibilities

* Make a daily contribution to the Founders & Coders Style Guide;
* Present it at the afternoon seminar;
* Produce one extended tutorial for your  blog;
* Enforce style guidelines within your group.

## Inspiration

* [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* [Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html)
* [GitHub CSS Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/css)
* [Node.js Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide)

The style guide is not just about the correct way to write JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Guidelines can also be about how to use Git and GitHub; how to use Jekyll and GitHub pages; how to set up a domain for your blog; how to add content to the DOM; how to do an API call; and just about any technical insight that your group has found useful.

For each daily tutorial, concentrate on understanding and presenting one piece of information. And do not be afraid to suggest corrections and amendments to existing guidelines (but discuss it with the original author first, if you can).
