# Facilities

This is a shared space. You are welcome to use the kitchen area, but please clean up after yourself and keep the surfaces clear.

I apologise in advance for the state of the toilets.

You are welcome to enjoy the garden and use it for working in.

We do not have a cleaner at 26, so we need to make sure we keep it clean ourselves.
