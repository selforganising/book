# Sysop

The System operator is responsible for introducing new tools to assist the team's build processes.

Sysops are expected to collaborate closely with each other.

The sysops should concentrate on introducing one new tool at a time, they should agree with the other sysops on which tool to introduce, and they should contribute to a whole-class tutorial on their chosen tool before moving on to the next tool.

Suggested list of build tools:
* Hypertest pre-processors (SCSS and Sass using Jekyll)
* Shims, fallbacks, and polyfills (HTML5-boilerplate, Modernizr...)
* Package managers (Bower and npm)
* Task runners (Gulp and Grunt)
* Scaffolding (Yeoman)
* Containers (Docker, Fig)
* dotfiles
* Editor tools
