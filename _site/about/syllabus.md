### Reading (and watching) list

[**Crockford on JavaScript**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB). A wonderful series of lectures by Doug Crockford. A panaramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. Make a note of any terms you do not understand (of which there will be several) and we can return to them over the course of the next two months. Watch each lecture until you are no longer enjoying the experience and then fast forward or move onto the next one (Lecture 3 is probably the hardest to follow), but don't give up until the last of the eight lectures. You may want to rewatch these lectures at the end of the course. Up to 10 hours of viewing pleasure.
