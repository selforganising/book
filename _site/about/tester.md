Testers are expected to collaborate closely with each other.

##Responsibilities

* Write tests (using *Mocha* and *Supertest*)
* Make sure that your team are all constantly running tests against their code
* Make sure that your team are all constantly using JSHint
* Move user stories in Trello into a stack called *"DONE: tests passing"* only when all test pass and all JavaScript code has been run through JSHint without errors or warnings
* Present a tutorial on some aspect of their work
* Handover to the new tester on Friday

See the notes on *BDD* in Week 1.
