## Take regular breaks

When working at a computer, it is very easy to forget to look after yourself. Remember to take a short break every 20 minutes or so. Lean back in your chair. Place the palm of your hands on your eyes or slowly turn your head around and focus your eyes in the middle distance or out of the window for 20 seconds. At least every hour, go for a walk and stretch your legs.
