# The afternoon seminar

We have a seminar at 2pm every day in which we will all take turns to present a topic.

We will decide on the topics as we go, but the topic for Day One will be on using a tool some of you may be familiar with called Trello.

The topic for Day Two will be on agile development and the project managers will need to prepare it together and nominate one of their number to present the seminar. They can use [this page](/week1/agile.html) as a jumping off point.
