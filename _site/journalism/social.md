#Synchronised social media posting   

##What:  
* synchronised post on all social media platforms   

##How: 
* Every member of F&C simultaneously posts a message on their social network accounts directing readers to their blog using the hashtag: #foundersandcoders  
* The initial post will be done manually. Subsequent posts can be automated using Buffer (bufferapp.com)  

##KPIs:  
* To measure the efficacy of the synchronised post at reaching an audience, tools will be used to measure the reach and activity of posts and the hashtag #foundersandcoders 
* The tools:      [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) convert the URL of your website to a Bitly link and use this in the social media posts. Bity will measure how many times the link is clicked. Ensure each member of your team uses the same Bitly link.      [Keyhole](http://keyhole.co/) 
*  enter the hashtag #foundersandcoders in to the Keyhole website to determine the hashtag’s reach and impressions (these terms are defined on the Keyhole website).  
* The data from these tools will be used to improve our social reach as the weeks progress.  
* Sign up for a free account with both of the above tools to use them.
