# Week 3 homework

##JavaScript Style Guide

Read the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). 

If you are tutoring next week, you might want to mine this guide for material.

##Node.js revision

Two options:

Either, read the [*The Node Beginner Book*](http://www.nodebeginner.org/) and try working through the exercises.

Or, complete [*Level 1: Intro to Node.js*](http://node.codeschool.com/levels/1/) on Code School.

Even better: try them both and tell us which one you prefer.

##Node.js extension topic

I am hoping later in the course to find time to cover [Express](http://expressjs.com/). To get a feel for it, you may want to take a look at a [Code School video](http://youtu.be/WkJyEBz0PTY) that somebody has posted on YouTube, which as it happens collects data from Twitter (but using an [old version](https://api.twitter.com/1/) of the Twitter API, so don't get excited about being able to bypass authentication).  

And if you think you can cope without any sleep this weekend, then try out the [Nodeschool lesson on Express](http://nodeschool.io/#expressworks).
