# Week 6

This week is going to be a bit different. Each table will start work on its own project.

But before you get started, there are a number of tools and libraries to get familiar with.

##express.js 

A web application framework for Node.js. [Express](http://expressjs.com/) will give you a higher level of abtraction than Node.js on its own. Once you have learnt the basics, it will make web app development quicker.

Take a look at [Getting started](http://expressjs.com/guide.html).

##Databases

Databases are a big topic, but we are going to get familiar with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/). This is the most widely-used NoSQL database and is a good fit for Node.js.

##Templating engines

you are already familiar with Jekyll. We are now going to get to know [jade.js](http://jade-lang.com/), a widely-used Node template engine.

##Code linting

We should all be using a code linting tool to detect errors in our code. 

For JavaScript developers, that means using [JSHint](http://jshint.com/).

For those of you using Sublime Text, take a look at [How To Use SublimeLinter 3](http://youtu.be/u6fvJRao-E4).

##Test frameworks

We are going to use [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), a JavaScript testing framework. Developed by Pivotal, who also created PivotalTracker.

##Stylesheet languages

You may have come across mentions of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) or [Less](http://lesscss.org/), or even [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/). Try Sass first, with the SCSS syntax.

## Frontend build tools

We are going to use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) ("the streaming build system"); [Bower](http://bower.io/) for managing dependencies in frontend code; and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/learning/) for creating application scaffolding.

##Docker - *optional*

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows you to replicate your application environment anywhere, so that you can deploy your application anywhere quickly--either for develpoment or deployment.

##Mobile app development - *optional*

There are several options, here including Titanium, Steroids, Trigger and actually learning Java and Objective-C, but we are going to use [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) (previously known as PhoneGap).

Where to start? 

Here: [THE DEAD-SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR FRONT-END DEVELOPERS TO GETTING UP AND RUNNING WITH NODE.JS, EXPRESS, JADE, AND MONGODB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/)

We will try to fill in more detail as we go.
