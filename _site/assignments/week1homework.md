# Week 1 homework

##Finish off pre-course assignments

Make sure that you finish the pre-course assignments and also return to the optional assignments, as and when you have time.

##Git and GitHub

Continue to get more familiar with Git. 

Start with [Git for the lazy](http://wiki.spheredev.org/Git_for_the_lazy) and [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

Watch [Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/videos), and also take a look at [GitHub & Git Foundations](http://vimeo.com/album/2763106/video/88271920) if you have time. 

And try out [learnGitBranching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/) ([Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) may be worth a spin, too).

##Chrome DevTools

Do the [Discover DevTools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) course at Code School. The DevTools are going to be be essential from now on.
