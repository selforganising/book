# Week 2 homework

##Node.js

[Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Watch [Introduction to Node.js with Ryan Dahl](http://youtu.be/jo_B4LTHi3I).

Install and run Nodeschool's [learnyounode](http://nodeschool.io/#learn-you-node) and follow the instructions.

Make as much progress as you can. If you get stuck, do not hesitate to google for answers.

If you have any problems installing Node.js on your computer, use [Nitrous.IO](http://nitrous.io/).

We will be returning to Node.js and Nodeschool next week.
