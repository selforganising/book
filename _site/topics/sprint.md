# A sprint

## Sprint planning

* Create user stories on post-it notes
* Transfer user stories to icebox in Tracker
* Play planning poker to estimate each story
* Estimate resources for the week
* Set velocity
* Move items out of Icebox

## Morning scrum

* Standup meeting
* Same time every day (don't wait for latecomers)
* What have you done yesterday?
* What do you plan to do today?
* Anything getting in your way?

## Sprint retrospective

* "start, stop, continue"
