#The clients

In the latter part of the course, we will select a group to act as a client for another group's project. No two groups will act as clients for each other.

The scope of each project sprint will need to be agreed with the client through the use of user stories on Trello, the sprint timetable and a time for a sprint review should be agreed at the beginning of the sprint. 

User stories should have a workflow that looks something like this:

* Agreed (not started)
* Started
* Finished
* Delivered
* Accepted
* Rejected

Stories should start in the *Agreed* stack and should end up as *Accepted*.

The *client* should nominate a *product owner* whose job it will be to *accept* or *reject* stories. This role can change between sprints. 

*Delivered* stories should all be available at a public URL, for the client to view.

At the end of the sprint, we will have a public sprint review, where the client can be as bolshy as they like, but the rest of us will keep quiet.
