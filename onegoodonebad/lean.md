# Lean
<br>
####Wtf lean?

Lean is **an approach to productivity** which sees the spending of resource on anything which doesn't lead to value creation as wasteful.

Lean has gained massive currency in the context of tech startups in recent years, through the work of [Eric Ries](http://theleanstartup.com/), among others. It's huge. You could spend your life reading about the upsides of lean and the minutiae of its various incarnations.

Perhaps the earliest and most famous of Lean's successes was the growth of [Toyota from a small company to the world's largest car manufacturer](http://www.toyota.com.au/toyota/company/operations/toyota-production-system) (before it was even called Lean).

<br>
####A project as a mechanism for value creation
<br>

<br>
The starting point with Lean is understanding the value you are going to create before you kick off a project and commit resource to it.

For established businesses this is usually easier because they have tested, predictable business models which are proven to create value. For startups and other new projects, it can be very difficult because they're searching for value in the dark.

    a great idea !== value

The classic mistake of a new project is overinvesting resource in a 'great idea' which has no known value.

Lean discipline requires that you don't spend any resource on anything which doesn't lead to value creation. So, if you don't **know** what value you can create, you shouldn't spend any resource. First, you need to find out what value you can create.

The purpose of this post is to show how lean methodology helps you acheive that.

## One good - buffer
<br>
####Wtf buffer?

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Buffer is a social media management tool allowing social media managers to queue up tweets. The product isn't that clever, but the way it began is.

Started by [Joel Gascoigne](http://joel.is/) who writes brilliantly on tech, startups and organisational health.

Joel took buffer [from an idea to a revenue-generating product in 7 weeks](http://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it).

<br>
####The idea

Joel noticed that the tweet queue features of existing social media management toolkits were clumsy and frustrating. He thought 'I can do better' and got to work coding up his own solution.

Then he remembered his lean principles. He realised he didn't actually **know** that he was creating something of value. So he bit his tongue and stopped investing time resource into the project. In fact, he went a step further and deleted all the code he'd written as an exercise in lean discipline. Hardcore.

After this he went about building a Lean v1

<br>
####v 1

That's v1. The whole of it.

The first thing you'll notice is that there is no product there. Just a landing page, a call to action (the green button) and a notice to inform interested users that buffer isn't yet ready to launch.

v1 is an experiment which Joel use to find out what value might look like. Getting users to click the Plans and Pricing gave Joel some validation that the idea had value.

So, he decided to invest a little more resource in Version 1.1

<br>
####v 1.1

![](http://f.cl.ly/items/450y3g301G2C12191g1I/Buffer-MVP-2.png)

Still no product here.

The update is that there's a pricing section in between the expression of interest and the 'we're not ready' page. This allowed Joel to build on his validation that the idea had value and get a better idea of how much value it might have.

**Plus**, by giving interested users a chance to submit their emails, JG was able to get in touch with a bunch of them and ask **them what they wanted him to sell them**. This is 'customer development' in Lean speak.

Only once Joel:
- **knew** his idea had value,
- **knew**  how much value it might have, and
- **knew** what his customers wanted him to build,

did he invest any time resource in coding the product up.

<br>
####The result

Joel nailed it.

He raised $400k, employs >20 people and runs one of the most sought after startups to work at.

## One bad - akimbo
<br>

####Wtf akimbo?

akimbo is the holding name for the website built over the weekend as the commercial face of aspiring developers coming out of Founders & Coders at Collective Academy.

<br>
####The idea
As it stands (October 2014) we know broadly that we want to supply digital services in exchange for cash to make a living.

Going any more specific than that puts us in the dark.

We don't really know which customers we might sell to, what problems those customers might be trying to solve and the scope of solutions we might offer. We haven't yet spoken to enough customers to be able to understand these things this.

Yet we've jumped right into building v1.

<br>
####v1

<br>
#####i. Strapline

The strapline ***"Web. Node.js. D3. Realtime." makes huge assumptions that potential customers either know what things like Node.js and D3 are and that they care about what technologies we might use to deliver digital services.

The great Harvard marketing professor Theodore Levitt used to tell his students, â€œPeople don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!"

My best guess is that customers will simply want their digital services providers to build 'tech stuff that works'. That's our customers' quarter-inch hole. By pitching Node.js and D3, we're selling people a quarter-inch drill.

<br>
#####ii. Landing page heavy on information, low on action

On the akimbo landing page a potential customer has to scroll through detailed information on tech (which is likely redundant) and the endless personal profiles before getting to a call to action.

The call to action is the only way by which a potential customer might convert to a paying customer via the website. There's a high risk that many potential customers wouldn't get to the call to action before they run out of time getting through content.

<br>
#####iii. >40 profiles on the landing page

There are >40 personal profiles on the landing page.

The purpose of personal profiles on websites is to establish credibility. As it stands only one individual represented on the landing page has established credibility in supplying digital services.

I'm concerned that a potential customer scrolling through all those profiles might develop a negative rather than a positive opinion of our credibility.

<br>
####The result

We have a very shaky web presence, with ~10 man days sunk into the build.


<br>
## Why am I banging on about this?
<br>

Because it matters

- **First**, because it will give us the best chance of building a viable agency business on the limited resources we have;

- **Second** because, in the context of that business, it will enable us to build great products for clients which will rapidly increase our ability, productivity and therefore credibility

- **Third** because if we adopt a common approach to productivity it will give us a strong foundation for working together and we'll be able to rely on each other to allocate resources sensibly for optimal value creation.

<br>
####An alternative?

As a first positive step to pull away from some of the negativity above, today I went and did a little customer development.

I met with a Collective member who has recently spent a large amount of money on business-critical digital services.

Below are some of his concerns in procuring digital skills, in random order:

<br>
#####Tender
He runs a competitive tender based on a brief which he sends to candidate agencies.

He expects a pitch deck in response to the brief which details:
- portfolio
- team
- scope of works
- fees
- processes should be agile and tracked by a recognised project management tool which he understands

Bonus points for special insight into the problem and differentiation from other agencies.

<br>
#####Team
He likes to kick off with the MD of the agency, a designer, a developer and a strategist.

Qualitative considerations include whether he likes the people and whether they have the right mix of skills and understanding of his problem.

Quantitaive considerations include fees, timings and milestones. He likes to know when he will see what.

<br>
#####Design
Beautiful, human friendly interfaces in the portfolio are a huge draw.

<br>
#####Tech
He doesn't care about the tech stack except to the extent that he has to interface with it. i.e. is there a GUI at the backend enabling him to maintain a site easily?

<br>
#####Thoughts on the Collective value proposition
He'd be terrified by the juniority of the developers

Would feel much more comfortable if the organisation were 'big brothered' by an established agency who might mentor/operationally underwrite the work. (Thinking Forward 3D??)

Low cost vs Typical agency is a draw. Push the fact it is a great deal and supporting a different kind of organisation.

Own a niche. Is there something Node.js is good for which a particular bunch of people are going to need?

A product lab would be cool to draw attention
