# Creating a new array

##Good – Array Literal Notation#

    var a = [‘1A’,’2B’];

##Bad – Array Constructor Notation#

    var a = new Array();
    a[0] =  “1A”;
    a[1] = “2B”;

Reason #1:

By creating new array, you run the risk of creating a variable called “Array”, which can  then overwrite your initial definition of your array. The odds of this are unlikely but this is one fore-seeable outcome which can be easily avoided by creating arrays differently.


Reason #2

    var a = new Array(1,2,3,4,5);
    a[0] // returns 1
    a.length // returns 5

    var a = new Array(10);
    a[0] // returns undefined
    a.length // returns 10, because of reasons.

However with only on integer to the constructor notation, this will create an array with a length of 10, rather than with the first input as 10. This is confusing and misleading.

#Good – Implicit Array Declation#

A third option for creating arrays, is to use a javascript method such as string.split

    var alpha = "I-learn-JavaScript";
    var beta = beta.split("-");

so 

    var beta = [“I”, “learn”, “JavaScript"]
