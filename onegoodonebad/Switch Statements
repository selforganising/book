#Using Switch Statement Rather than If/Or Statements#

Using switches can be a great way to simplify more complicated else if statements in Javascript. It is a mechanism through which to keep your code neat and easily adjustable.

Modern Web recommends that you use this whenever you have more than two cases. 

Bad:
	  if (example_variable == "cyan") {  
	      // do something here...  
	  } else if (example_variable == "magenta") {  
	      // do something here...  
	  } else if (example_variable == "yellow") {  
	      // do something here...  
	  } else if (example_variable == "black") {  
	      // do something here...  
	  } else {  
	      // do something here...  
	  }  

Good:
	  switch (example_variable) {  
	      case "cyan":  
	          // do something here...  
	          break;  
	      case "magenta":  
	          // do something here...  
	          break;  
	      case "yellow":  
	          // do something here...  
	          break;  
	      case "black":  
	          // do something here...  
	          break;  
	      default:  
	          // do something here...  
	          break;  
	  }  
Breaks sole purpose is in my understanding to stop the code from running through the rest of the switch-case.

The second block of code does the exact same thing as the first â€” but the second one is cleaner, easier to read, and easier to maintain and modify.
