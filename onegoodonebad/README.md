# One good, one bad

This could also be described as *"One good, one better"* or *"One good in one context and one good in another"*, or even *One bad, one good, one better*.

It is a tweak of the *quick talks*, but with re-defined criteria.

This should be a two-minute, one-slide presentation with three minutes for questions.

###Guidelines

Please choose any two short code snippets that do the same or similar things and cover:

* What the code snippets do
* Where you might use them
* Which one is better and why
* Where you might not use the "better" one and why

And create a single page to accompany your talk for the GitBook.

**Please fork the [GitBook](https://github.com/selforganising/book)**, add a page using [Markdown](http://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/markdown/) under /onegoodonebad and make a pull request.

You can if you want take an existing *One good, one bad* and attempt to improve upon it.

Thank you.
