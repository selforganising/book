# Week 6: Add comments to the blog

Add a commenting feature to the blog. You should attempt to make comments a separate service, accessible as JSON and loaded into your page with jQuery. You should negotiate the behaviour of the service with the client.

Meanwhile, you should continue to explore Hapi, including:
* User registration using *hapi-auth-basic* and *bell*
* Caching using *catbox*
* Logging with *good*
