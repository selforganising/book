# Week7: Add comments to the blog

Add a commenting feature to the blog. You should attempt to make comments a separate service, accessible as JSON and loaded into your page with jQuery. You should negotiate the behaviour of the service with your *client*.

Meanwhile, you should continue to explore Hapi, including:
* Using Packs and Plugins
* Separating out functionality into separate files
* User registration using *hapi-auth-basic* and *bell*
* Caching using *catbox*
* Logging with *good*


The schedule of the week is as follows:

### Monday
* 10am: Identify the scope of the project in project teams
* 11am: Pair up in two groups for the first round of sprint planning meetings
* 11:30am: Pair up in two groups for the second round of sprint planning meetings
* 12pm Return to project groups and identify gaps in knowledge
* 2pm *Testers* and *DevOps* get together in *role* groups and ensure that all groups have a full suite of tests using *lab* and a working production environment and logging using *good*. Meanwhile, the remaining team members should get together in two groups (stay away from your clients) to start work on projects.

### Tuesday
* 2pm *Testers* and *DevOps* present turorials. 
* 2.30pm Project teams hand over their respective projects.
* 3pm The *Repo owners* and *Librarians* should get together to prepare tutorials for Wednesday. Remaining team members should pair up into two groups.

### Wednesday 
2pm *Repo owners* and *Librarians* present tutorials and then everyone returns to their project groups to complete the first sprint.

###Testers
Should continue to get familiar with *lab* and ensure that your team are writing adequate tests.

###DevOps
Should ensure that your project is publishing to a public repo where the client can view it and that the teams are using logging with *good*.

###Repo owners
Should ensure that your team is using a sensible branching strategy and sticking to it.
 
###Librarians
Should continue to expand your team's knowledge of the Hapi ecosystem.
