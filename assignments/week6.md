# Week 6: build a blog using *hapi*

The blog should have the following elements:

* Submission of new blog entries
* Viewing of existing entries
* Editing of existing blog entries
* Listing of all blog entries

You should build your blog step by step, as follows:

* Write acceptance tests
* Build a JSON API using RESTful routes
* Save and retrieve entries using a MongoDB database
* Add HTML pages using templates

for your second sprint, you should aim to add:
* User registration using *hapi-auth-basic* and *bell*
* Caching using *catbox*
* Logging with *good*
* Rich-text editing

Before starting on this project, you should spend time in role-based groups as follows:

###Testers
Research testing using *lab* and error handling with *boom*.

###Repo owners
Research RESTful routes and routing in hapi
 
###DevOps
Research validation with *joi* and connecting to MongoDB

###Librarians
Research templating libraries, including Swig and Jade.

### Quick talks and code reviews

Each group will be expected to present a quick talk at 2pm.

You will then all return to your teams and we will have code reviews at 5pm.
