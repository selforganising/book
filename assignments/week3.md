Go to [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) and follow the instructions for learnyounode.

### Modus operandi

For the start of this week we are not going to be working in our project teams.

Here is the plan:

1. Use lollysticks to divide 12 people randomly into 6 pairs
1. Remaining 3 students act as tutors (or *ignorant schoolmasters*).

Tutors circulate around the classroom. They can ask questions, but they cannot ask any leading questions and they cannot attempt to provide answers. Their job is to satisfy themselves that they understand what the pair programmers are doing and that each of the pair understand what they are saying. 

We will try this for an hour and then swap the roles around.
