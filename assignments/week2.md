#Week 2: Client-side developer challenge 

The Challenge will be posted on gitter.

####Time: one week  

An experienced frontend developer could perhaps produce working code within a few hours, but you will have a week to meet--and exceed--the brief. You will be expected to add the pages for this project to your existing blog, hosted on GitHub.   

Your code will be reviewed at 5pm on Thursday by an external assessor. You will then have time on Friday to respond to his feedback and produce a final version of the challenge.
