##Relational Databases
Contains one or more objects called tables. These tables are identified by their name and are comprised of columns and rows. Think of a normal excel spreadsheet. 

Developed by Edgar F. Codd. He wanted to be able to ask the computer for information, and then let the computer figure out where and how the information is stored and how to retrieve it.

Basic idea was that relationships between data items should be based on the item’s values.
