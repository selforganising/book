# Factorial

Find the [factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a number.

There are several solutions to this problem. You are welcome to try more than one.

You can assume that the arguments will always be positive integers or, if you prefer, you can test for rogue input.

Here are some suggestions:

* use iteration
* use recursion
* do it as a one-liner
* use memoization
* use invariant programming with an accumulator

This is a paired programming exercice. Pair up with the next person who comes through the door.

And don't forget to write tests.
